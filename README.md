# Bitcoin Core Report
# https://quarch.netlify.app/
A detailed 46-page architectural report and case study of Bitcoin Core, i.e., the reference open-source client of the Bitcoin protocol for electronic payments. After an extensive analysis of the source code of Bitcoin Core and discussing divergences from the conceptual design, we proposed a thesis to enhance performance, security, and maintainability by combining the P2P and Network Consensus Validation subsystems. Completed in a team of 6 as a third-year university capstone project for my software architecture course (CISC 322, Queen's University). The purpose of this project was to widen the comprehension of software in the context of large-scale systems with numerous modules and dependencies. A video presentation of this project's deliverables can be found at the site linked above.

# [Part 1: Conceptual Architecture Report](https://github.com/sean-y-liang/Bitcoin-Core-Report/blob/4a3c754eaa6e224fd1e0e7afa9b36691b70bf43b/Part%201%20-%20Bitcoin%20Core%20Conceptual%20Architecture%20Report.pdf)
Identify and document the conceptual architecture of Bitcoin Core.
# [Part 2: Concrete Architecture Report](https://github.com/sean-y-liang/Bitcoin-Core-Report/blob/fb4c877d9f34a0af21d68bc1453e0333e206f3de/Part%202%20-%20Bitcoin%20Core%20Concrete%20Architecture%20Report.pdf)
Recover the concrete architecture of the Bitcoin Core by studying the source code, then identify and discuss divergences from the conceptual architecture.
# [Part 3: Proposal for Enchancement](https://github.com/sean-y-liang/Bitcoin-Core-Report/blob/fb4c877d9f34a0af21d68bc1453e0333e206f3de/Part%203%20-%20Bitcoin%20Core%20Proposal%20for%20Enhancement%20Report.pdf)
Conceptualize an enchancement or addition to Bitcoin Core, i.e., the combination of the P2P and the Network Consensus Validation subsystems, and explain the value and benefit of it. Discuss the changes required so the current architecture can support the enhancement. Explain which components and interfaces must change and what should change at the high level, as well as the impact the architectural change may produce and the potential risks of these changes.
