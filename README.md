# Bitcoin Core Review
A detailed 46-page architecture report and case study of Bitcoin Core, i.e., the reference open-source client of the Bitcoin protocol for electronic payments. Completed in a group of 6 as my third-year unviversity capstone project for a software architecture course (CISC 322, Queen's University). The purpose of this project was to widen the understanding of software architecture in the context of a large software system.
