# Bitcoin Core Report
# https://quarch.netlify.app/
A detailed 46-page architecture report and case study of Bitcoin Core, i.e., the reference open-source client of the Bitcoin protocol for electronic payments. Completed in a group of 6 as my third-year unviversity capstone project for a software architecture course (CISC 322, Queen's University). The purpose of this project was to widen the understanding of software architecture in the context of a large software system. A video presentation of this project's deliverables can be found at the site linked above.

# Part 1: Conceptual Architecture Report 
[a relative link](Part 1 - Bitcoin Core Conceptual Architecture Report.pdf)
Identify and document the conceptual architecture of Bitcoin Core.
# Part 2: Concrete Architecture Report
Recover the concrete architecture of the Bitcoin Core by studying the source code, then identify and discuss divergences from the conceptual architecture.
# Part 3: Proposal for Enchancement
Conceptualize an enchancement or addition to Bitcoin Core, i.e., the combination of the P2P and the Consensus Validation subsystems, and explain the value and benefit of it. Discuss the changes required so the current architecture can support the enhancement. Explain which components and interfaces must change and what should change at the high level, as well as the impact the architectural change may produce and the potential risks of these changes.
